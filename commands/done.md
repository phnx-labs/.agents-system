description: Recap the session, then cleanly self-exit (SIGTERM the harness). For the ship gate (test/docs/PR/release) use /finish instead.

You are wrapping up this session. Context: $ARGUMENTS

`/done` means: **produce a recap, emit it as your message, then terminate this session yourself.**
It is the agent-side equivalent of the user typing `/exit` — but with a handoff recap first.

> **`/done` vs `/finish`** — `/done` *recaps and leaves*: it assumes the work is already delivered
> and you just want a clean handoff before the session ends. If the work is **not** actually finished
> — you're stalled at a blocker, a partial handoff, or untested code — use **`/finish`**, which drives

There is no `/exit` tool exposed to you — the only self-exit available is signalling the harness
process directly. That is deliberate and is the last step below.

## Step 1: Build the recap

Summarize the current state of work for handoff. Facts before hypotheses; ground every claim.

- **Situation** — what was the goal, and where did it end up? One short paragraph.
- **Completed** — concrete work done, with `file:line` / commit / PR / command-output evidence.
- **In progress** — anything started but not finished (be honest).
- **Blocked / open questions** — what genuinely needs the user (credentials, judgment, a click).
- **Next** — the single most useful next action.

Apply the `/recap` discipline:
- **Check before you list.** Anything you could verify or run yourself right now — do it, fold the
  answer in, don't list it as a "next step."
- **No wastebasket bullets.** Don't punt trivial loose ends or micro-decisions into "Next." Finish
  them, or turn a real fork into a crisp recommendation.
- Only keep items in **Next** that truly need the user's input, credentials, judgment, or a click
  you can't make.

Emit the recap as your assistant message **now** — it must be printed BEFORE the exit, because once
the harness dies nothing else you say will reach the user. The recap is the last thing they'll see.

## Step 2: Self-exit

After the recap is written, terminate the session as your final action. The Bash tool shell's parent
(`$PPID`) is the agent harness; sending it `SIGTERM` is the clean shutdown path — the harness flushes
the transcript, saves session state, and runs post-session hooks on its way out (unlike `SIGKILL`).

Run this as the LAST tool call of the turn (do not write any text after it):

```bash
HP=$PPID
HC=$(ps -o comm= -p "$HP" 2>/dev/null | tr -d ' ')
echo "self-exit: harness PID=$HP comm=$HC at $(date '+%H:%M:%S')"
case "$HC" in
  sshd|tmux*|init|systemd|login|bash|-bash|zsh|-zsh)
    echo "refusing self-exit: parent ($HC) is not an agent harness — aborting so we don't kill infra" ;;
  *)
    kill -TERM "$HP"
    echo "SIGTERM sent to $HP — if you can still read this, the harness ignored it" ;;
esac
```

The guard rejects obvious infrastructure parents (a bare shell, tmux, sshd, init/systemd) so `/done`
never tears down the wrong process; a real harness (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `node`, etc.) is
anything else and gets the signal. If the guard refuses, report that the self-exit was skipped and
why — do not escalate to `SIGKILL` or walk further up the tree.
