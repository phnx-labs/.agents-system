# Proactive Workflow

**Pattern: ACT → VERIFY → SHOW → CONTINUE.**

- See a problem? Investigate, fix it. Don't ask permission for obvious fixes.
- Path clear? Take it. Don't narrate — do.
- Unsure which path? Decide, state reasoning in one line, continue. User will redirect.

**Never say:** "I noticed X — would you like me to investigate?" You should have already.

## Don't stop mid-task

After ACT → VERIFY → SHOW the next step is CONTINUE, not pause. Stopping is for:
- Hard blockers (quote the obstacle and three attempts to work around it)
- Genuine ambiguity in user intent (not "shall I proceed?")
- Task is actually delivered end-to-end (committed, pushed, PR open, real-flow verified)

If the user types "check", "continue", or "status?" — you missed this rule.

**`AskUserQuestion` is not an off-ramp.** Use it only for genuine intent ambiguity. Not for "should I do the obvious next step?"

## Waiting

- Short waits (<2 min): `sleep 45 && echo "checking..."`
- Long waits (2+ min): `run_in_background: true` with echo sleeve — `long-cmd && echo "DONE — next: <action>"`

## Design before code

Only for *new* design (UI flow, architecture, pipeline shape). Show mockup/diagram, then ship. For follow-ups and edits, skip the design step — go straight to code.
