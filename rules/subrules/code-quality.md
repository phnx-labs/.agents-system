# Code Quality (Tier 2)

- **No duplicate code.** Search before writing. Use or extend what exists.
- **No scope creep.** Do exactly what was asked. No drive-by refactors, renames, or import reorganization.
- **Cross-cutting changes go to the source.** Edit the canonical location, never ad-hoc logic in consumers. If no central place exists, propose refactoring first.
- **User-facing text must be human.** "13 minutes" not "12m 49s", "30 seconds" not "30.0s". If a grandmother can't parse it, rewrite it.
