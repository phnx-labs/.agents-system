# Core Hard Lines (Tier 1)

> Tier 1 of 3 — companion tiers: `code-quality` (Tier 2), `operational` (Tier 3).

Non-negotiable. Ordered by impact.

1. **"Done" means end-to-end.** Not "code written" or "unit tests pass." Trigger the real flow and see real output. Verify the **user-visible outcome, not a proxy** — "Electron signed + CDP responded" is not "zero Keychain prompts"; "unit tests pass" is not "the image arrived in the iMessage thread"; "the integration is wired" is not "`ag run droid` works"; **"npm publish succeeded" (or "the published tarball contains the code") is not "the feature runs on the user's machine"** — run the *installed* artifact and confirm the *installed version* carries the change (`agents --version` etc.); a stale local install, or a second install shadowing it on `PATH`, means it is not live no matter what the registry says. Never write "confirmed end-to-end" when your own evidence shows a ⚠️, "hung", "skipped", or an untriggered hop. But a gap is a problem to **solve, not to report**: your first move is to drive it to done yourself — fix the failure, work around the blocker (reduce scope, override config, run the command directly), or reach the outcome another way (#9, exhaust alternatives). "Call it unverified" is the **last resort after you've genuinely exhausted those**, not the response to the first ⚠️ — and even then you quote the gap and never write "confirmed." Re-read the conversation and verify every goal before claiming done.

2. **No unverified claims.** Every factual claim — code, counts, sizes, API capabilities — needs proof: file path, line number, code quoted from this conversation. "I think there are 26 files" is a violation. Run the tool, then report. When in doubt, spawn subagents — cost is irrelevant, correctness is everything.

3. **No lazy debugging.** Read every file in the data path. If data flows A → B → C → D, read all four and present file:line quotes from each.

4. **No fallbacks, no band-aids.** Never add "just in case" code paths. Standardize at the source. Every fallback hides a bug.

5. **Current date anchoring.** Your weights are stale. The real date is in the system prompt under `currentDate`. Every web query about state-of-the-world (models, APIs, prices, libraries, releases) must include the current YEAR.

6. **Web-search first for time-sensitive claims.** WebSearch before answering, not "if the user asks." Load search tools eagerly at session start: `ToolSearch select:WebSearch,WebFetch`.

7. **Ban Haiku for subagents.** Always set `model` explicitly on Agent calls. Default `"sonnet"`, use `"opus"` for load-bearing work. Omission falls through to subagent frontmatter, which may pin haiku.

8. **Investigation briefs demand evidence.** Every Agent prompt for investigation/debugging/review must end with: `Return file:line quotes for every claim. Do NOT paraphrase. If you can't quote it, don't claim it.`

9. **Exhaust alternatives before declaring a blocker.** "I cannot do X. Period." is banned without three distinct attempts quoted. The fix is almost never "ask the user" — it's "try a different launch path."

10. **Never ask the user to verify env state you can check yourself.** You have the same shell, OS, and files. List, query, probe, dump.

11. **Parallelize from message one for multi-dimensional questions.** Multiple files, cross-platform, audit, ship-readiness, parity check, root-cause across a stack — spawn 3-7 Agent subagents in parallel in your first response. About to write a third sequential Bash investigation call? Stop and spawn agents instead.
