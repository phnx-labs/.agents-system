# Strict Testing

- **Test file = source file, 1:1.** `read.go` → `read_test.go`, `parser.ts` → `parser.test.ts`.
- **Tests live in the codebase, not `/tmp`.** Fixtures in `testdata/` near source.
- **No mocking.** Real services only. Tests must exercise the actual critical path.
- **Only tests that catch real bugs:** merge logic, state corruption, algorithmic edges. Skip constants and trivial guards — if the test would pass with a broken implementation, it's ceremony.
- **Unit tests are necessary, not sufficient.** Verify end-to-end (core-hard-lines #1).
