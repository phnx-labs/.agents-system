# swarm:qa — provision instances, then QA them in waves

> Read `swarm:orchestrate` first for the fan-out mechanics, provider discovery (`agents teams doctor` / `agents view --json`), and the judgment-based sizing rule. This skill is the **QA mode**: you are the smart admin who decides how to split QA across an app, stands up parallel instances, and runs agents against them in innings.

You are QA-ing: **$ARGUMENTS**

This is **behavioral QA of a running app** — click the real flows, watch the real output — not a unit-test runner (that's `/swarm:test`) and not a code diff gate (that's `/code:verify`). The driver is `agents browser` (CDP); the parallelism comes from running the app on **multiple ports at once** and fanning agents across them in **waves**.

## Phase 1 — Recon & split (you, the orchestrator)

Map the QA surface before spawning anything:
- Enumerate the critical flows, pages, and endpoints. If a canonical checklist exists for this app (e.g. a `QA.md`), use its sections as the natural split.
- Group into **independent QA tasks** — each a self-contained flow one agent can walk start-to-finish.
- Decide **wave size** and **agent count by judgment** (per `swarm:orchestrate` — no fixed table): more parallelism for a wide app, less for a focused surface. A wave is roughly as many tasks as you have free instances × signed-in providers.
- If a flow depends on a current external truth (a third-party API's behavior, a pricing screen, a SOTA expectation), **WebSearch with the current year** so agents QA against ground truth, not stale assumptions.

## Phase 2 — Provision instances (this skill spins them up)

Parallel QA needs parallel targets. This skill is your explicit authorization to **start app instances** — provision them, and **tear them all down in Phase 5**.

1. Find how the app runs and where the port is set — read its run scripts / dev-server invocation. Common shapes:
   - Web: `bun run dev` / `next dev` with a port override (`PORT=3001 bun run dev` or `--port 3001`).
   - Electron / native via CDP: launch with `--remote-debugging-port=<port>` (the established convention is `rush-local` on CDP `9222`, `rush-mac-mini` on `9223`).
2. Stand up **K instances on distinct ports**, K sized to the machine and the wave (don't exhaust the box). Health-check each (`curl -sS localhost:<port>` or the CDP `/json` endpoint) before using it — an instance that didn't bind is not a target.
3. Point a browser profile at each: reuse `rush-local` / `rush-mac-mini` where they fit, or create per-port profiles (`agents browser profiles create qa-<port> ...`).
4. **Fallback:** if the app genuinely can't run multiple instances, drop to **one shared instance with serialized waves** — fewer agents per inning, more innings. Say so in the recon summary; don't silently pretend you parallelized.

## Phase 3 — Plan the waves (innings)

Batch the QA tasks into waves. Assign each task an **agent (mixed signed-in providers)** and a **target port**. **Pre-declare every wave up front** and chain them with `--after` — hot-adding to a live team is not a clean primitive, so wave N+1's teammates are added now with `--after` on wave N's teammate names, and `start` drains the DAG, launching each inning as the previous one frees its agents and ports.

```bash
agents teams create qa-<app-slug>
# Wave 1 — first batch, each on its own port
agents teams add qa-<app-slug> claude "<brief: flow A @ port 3001>" --name w1-flowA --mode plan
agents teams add qa-<app-slug> codex  "<brief: flow B @ port 3002>" --name w1-flowB --mode plan
# Wave 2 — starts when wave 1 frees the ports/agents
agents teams add qa-<app-slug> gemini "<brief: flow C @ port 3001>" --name w2-flowC --after w1-flowA --mode plan
agents teams add qa-<app-slug> claude "<brief: flow D @ port 3002>" --name w2-flowD --after w1-flowB --mode plan
agents teams start qa-<app-slug> --watch
```

`--mode plan` for observe/triage agents (the default — they read and report). `--mode edit` **only** for an agent whose job is to actually write bug reports to a file or issue tracker.

## Phase 4 — Execute & observe

Each QA agent's brief (full template in `swarm:orchestrate`) tells it to drive **its assigned port** and, critically, to **drain the silent-failure channels after every meaningful step**, not just at the end:

```bash
export AGENTS_BROWSER_TASK=$(agents browser start --profile qa-<port>)
agents browser tab add --url <flow entry>
agents browser click <ref> / type <ref> --text "..."
agents browser screenshot                 # visual evidence per step
agents browser console --level error      # JS errors the UI swallowed
agents browser errors                     # page/network errors
agents browser requests --filter api      # failed/4xx/5xx calls behind a "working" screen
agents browser done
```

A screen that *looks* fine while `console`/`errors`/`requests` show failures is a FAIL — this draining habit is the load-bearing part of UI QA. Each agent records, per flow: steps taken, screenshots, drained logs, and a verdict.

Monitor with `agents teams status qa-<app-slug> --since <iso-ts>` (sleep-poll, never `Monitor`). Unblock a stalled agent by reading its log and re-briefing.

## Phase 5 — Synthesize & tear down

- Aggregate findings across all waves; **dedupe** the same bug reported by multiple agents.
- Rank by severity using the reused taxonomy: **PASS** (flow works) / **REVIEW** (works but suspect) / **FAIL** (broken flow) / **BLOCKED** (couldn't test). For a release pass, roll up to a single **SHIP / NO-SHIP**.
- Each finding gets: the flow, the agent + provider, repro steps, and evidence (screenshot path + quoted log line). No claim without evidence.
- **`agents teams disband qa-<app-slug>`** and **kill every instance you started** (and any SSH-launched remote ones). Leaving dev servers running is a guardrail violation.

## Output

### Summary
App, surface covered, instances/ports used, waves run, providers mixed. Overall verdict (SHIP / NO-SHIP or PASS-rate).

### Findings (ranked)
Per finding: severity, flow, agent (provider), repro steps, evidence (screenshot + log quote).

### Coverage gaps
Flows not reached and why (BLOCKED reasons), so the next pass knows where to start.

### Teardown
Instances stopped, team disbanded — confirmed.
