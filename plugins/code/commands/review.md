description: Recap the session's goal, list every PR it opened, review each in parallel with anti-overengineering guardrails, then merge / request-changes / close-as-duplicate per verdict.
---

Review the PRs this session produced and decide what ships. Arguments (optional): $ARGUMENTS

- Default: review every PR opened in this session, score against the session's stated goal, act on the verdicts (merge / request changes / close).
- Pass an explicit PR list (e.g. `#412 #413 #414`) in $ARGUMENTS to review only those PRs instead of auto-detecting.
- Pass `dry-run` to print the plan and stop — no comments, no merges, no closes.
- Pass `no-merge` to comment verdicts but never merge (request-changes and close-as-duplicate still execute).

## HARD LINE — DO NOT MERGE WITHOUT EVIDENCE THE THING ACTUALLY RUNS

A PR that "looks correct" is not the same as a PR that has been demonstrated to work. Before merging, you must have at least one of:

1. A green CI run on the PR's head SHA (`gh pr checks <pr> --watch=false` shows all required checks passing).
2. A quoted command + output from this session showing the changed code path executing end-to-end (curl response, test run, screenshot, log line — quoted, not paraphrased).
3. An explicit user approval that overrides this gate. The user typing "ship it" or selecting "Yes, merge" in `AskUserQuestion` counts. "It looks good" does not.

If you have none of those, the verdict is **request-changes**, not merge. State the missing evidence in the PR comment.

## HARD LINE — NO OVERREVIEW, NO OVERENGINEERING PRESSURE

The review subagents you spawn are NOT here to find every possible improvement. They are here to answer **five questions** and stop:

1. **Goal:** Does this PR meet the stated session goal it was opened for? (Quote the goal. Quote the diff lines that satisfy it.)
2. **Evidence:** Is there proof the changed path actually runs? (CI green, test output, curl response, screenshot — quote it.)
3. **Quality:** Is the code reasonable? (No dead branches, no obvious bugs, no copy-paste duplication.) "Reasonable" is the bar — not "perfect."
4. **Cleanup:** Does the PR remove what it replaces, or does it leave the old thing alongside the new thing? Parallel implementations are a defect.
5. **Scope:** Did the PR stay in its lane, or did it sprawl into unrelated refactors / renames / formatting passes?

That is the entire rubric. Things subagents must NOT comment on:

- Style nits already enforced by lint/format (the linter is the source of truth — don't relitigate).
- Hypothetical future requirements ("what if we later want…?"). YAGNI applies to reviews too.
- Naming preferences absent a concrete confusion the name causes.
- Test coverage for trivial guards / constants — only flag missing tests where the code path has real branching or state risk.
- Suggestions to add abstractions, helpers, factories, interfaces, base classes "for flexibility." Three similar lines is fine.
- Documentation suggestions unless the PR introduces a user-facing surface that has no docs at all.

The output of each subagent is a **terse verdict** with file:line evidence, not an essay.

## Process

### 1. Recap — what was the session trying to do?

Reconstruct the session's intent before looking at any PR. The recap must be grounded — no paraphrase, no invention.

Sources (use all that apply):

- The user's first substantive message in this conversation — quote the goal verbatim.
- Any plan that was confirmed (look for `ExitPlanMode` content, or a "let's do X, Y, Z" the user explicitly approved).
- Linear ticket(s) opened or referenced — `gh issue view` / linear context from the session-start hook.
- `agents teams` distribution plan if one was used (boundary contracts name the goal per teammate).

Present the recap as:

```
Session goal: <one or two sentences, quoted or tightly paraphrased>
Confirmed by:  <message timestamp or "plan approved at <step>" or "linear PROJ-XXX">
Subgoals:
  - <subgoal 1>          → expected surface: <files/dirs>
  - <subgoal 2>          → expected surface: <files/dirs>
```

If you can't ground the goal in something the user said in this session, STOP. Ask via `AskUserQuestion` for the goal in one sentence before continuing. Reviewing without a goal is theater.

### 2. Discover the PRs this session opened

Run in parallel:

```bash
gh pr list --author "@me" --state open --limit 50 --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,createdAt,url,isDraft,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup
gh pr list --state open --limit 50 --search "in:title $(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)" --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,createdAt,url
git log --oneline --since="6 hours ago" --all
git branch -a --sort=-committerdate | head -40
```

Build a candidate set from:

- PRs whose `createdAt` is inside this session's window.
- PRs whose head branch matches a branch this session created (cross-check against `git reflog` + recent branches).
- PRs explicitly named in `$ARGUMENTS` (these override the auto-detect — review exactly that set).
- PRs opened by an `agents teams` run started in this session (check `agents sessions --active` and recent team branches).

If the result is empty, say so and stop — "No PRs opened in this session to review."

### 3. Build the dependency graph (detect stacked PRs)

For each candidate PR, record `{number, title, head, base, author, draft, ci_state, mergeable, url}`. Then construct the stack graph:

- If PR B's `baseRefName` equals PR A's `headRefName`, B is **stacked on** A. Draw an edge A → B.
- If multiple PRs share the same base (e.g., `main`), they are **independent** — flat list, no edges.
- A chain A → B → C must merge in order A, then B, then C. After A merges, B's base auto-retargets (or needs `gh pr edit <B> --base main` + a rebase). Document that.

Validate the graph with `gh pr view <n> --json baseRefName,headRefName` for each PR — don't trust the cached list if it's older than a few minutes.

### 4. Present the recap + PR table

Print before launching any subagent. **Use a GitHub-flavored markdown table — not ASCII box-drawing characters.** Box-drawing forces manual column alignment and breaks the moment a title is wider than the placeholder. Markdown tables auto-size, render correctly in Claude Code's UI, and stay readable when the agent's underlying terminal lacks fancy Unicode width support.

```markdown
Session goal: <quoted>

PRs opened this session: N

| PR    | Title                              | Base          | Head            | CI      | Mergeable | Notes               |
|-------|------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| #412  | feat: add oauth refresh            | main          | auth-refresh    | green   | clean     |                     |
| #413  | feat: wire login UI                | auth-refresh  | login-ui        | pending | clean     | stacked on #412     |
| #414  | test: add login flow e2e           | login-ui      | login-e2e       | —       | unknown   | possible duplicate? |

Stack graph:
  main ← #412 ← #413 ← #414     (merge order: 412, 413, 414)

Independents: none.
```

Rules for the table:

- **One row per PR.** Never split a single PR's fields across multiple lines — column counts must be uniform (markdown tables fail silently if a row has fewer/more `|` than the header).
- **Truncate the Title column to ~50 chars max** with an ellipsis if needed — long titles wreck readability even in markdown tables. The PR number is the unambiguous identifier.
- **Keep cell content single-line.** No embedded newlines, no nested tables, no `<br>`.
- **Use the Notes column** for duplicate flags, "stacked on #X", "draft", "conflicts" — not extra rows.
- Empty cells use `—` (em dash) or blank, not `N/A` or `null`.

Flag any PR that looks like a **duplicate** or **already-merged-elsewhere** in the Notes column — confirm with `git rev-list --count <head>..origin/main` and `git log origin/main --grep "<title>"` before claiming it.

### 5. Spawn one review subagent per PR — in parallel

Use the `Agent` tool. **One subagent per PR, all dispatched in a single message** so they run concurrently. Always set `model: "sonnet"` (or `"opus"` for a load-bearing PR — auth, billing, migrations). Never let it default.

Each subagent gets this brief — fill in the bracketed parts:

```
Mission: Review PR #<N> and return a terse verdict.

Session goal (the WHY this PR exists): "<quoted session goal>"
This PR's stated purpose (from title/body): "<quoted>"
Stacked context: <"depends on #X" | "independent">

Read these:
  - The PR diff:    gh pr diff <N>
  - The PR body:    gh pr view <N> --json title,body,headRefName,baseRefName,statusCheckRollup
  - CI status:      gh pr checks <N>
  - Touched files in full (not just the diff) for any non-trivial change: <list paths from the diff>

Answer EXACTLY these five questions, in this order, with file:line evidence quoted from the diff:

1. GOAL: Does this PR meet the stated session goal it was opened for? Quote the goal. Quote the diff lines that satisfy it. (YES / PARTIAL / NO)
2. EVIDENCE: Is there proof the changed path actually runs? Quote the CI rollup, test output, or any command output from the PR description. (YES / MISSING)
3. QUALITY: Any concrete bugs, dead branches, or obvious defects? Quote file:line for each. ("clean" is a valid answer.)
4. CLEANUP: Does this PR remove what it replaces, or leave parallel implementations? If there's a sibling old path still in the tree, quote it. (CLEAN / DUPLICATES <path>)
5. SCOPE: Did the PR stay in its lane, or sprawl? List any files changed that are outside the stated purpose. (TIGHT / SPRAWL: <files>)

Then give ONE verdict:
  - SHIP — all five answers are good. State why this is safe to merge in ONE sentence.
  - REQUEST_CHANGES — list 1-5 bullet points, each with file:line and the exact change needed. No prose around them.
  - CLOSE_DUPLICATE — the work is already in main (quote the commit) or another open PR (quote the #).

Do NOT propose abstractions, renames, doc additions, test additions for trivial code, naming preferences, or "what if later." Do NOT relitigate lint/format. The bar is "reasonable and meets the goal," not "perfect."

Return file:line quotes for every claim. Do NOT paraphrase. If you can't quote it, don't claim it.
```

After all subagents return, aggregate the verdicts.

### 6. Show the verdict matrix

```
Verdicts:
  #412  SHIP             — auth refresh complete, CI green, replaces old middleware (deleted src/auth/legacy.go).
  #413  REQUEST_CHANGES  — 3 concrete asks (login-ui session token storage location, missing error handling on refresh, dead import).
  #414  CLOSE_DUPLICATE  — e2e covered by existing tests/login.e2e.ts (commit a97ae40 in main).

Merge plan (stack order):
  1. #412  → merge (squash)
  2. #413  → after fixes land, re-review; do not merge yet
  3. #414  → close as duplicate of a97ae40
```

If any PR is REQUEST_CHANGES, the stack pauses at that point — do NOT merge anything stacked on top of it.

### 7. Confirm before any write action

Use `AskUserQuestion` with concrete counts: "Merge N PRs, request changes on M, close C as duplicate?" Options are forward actions only (per the project's HARD LINE on never proposing to stop):

- "Yes — execute the plan"
- "Just comment, don't merge"  (equivalent to `no-merge`)
- "Show me one verdict's evidence first" (then re-prompt)

Never include "stop" or "cancel" as a forward option — the user can always interrupt. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `dry-run`, skip this step and stop after printing the plan.

### 8. Execute the verdicts

Order matters. Do these in sequence per PR; PRs across the stack are processed in stack order (base → tip).

**8a. SHIP verdict — comment + merge.**

Post a single approval comment that states the safety case in 2-4 lines max — what was checked, the evidence (quoted CI line or curl response), and the cleanup confirmation. Example:

```bash
gh pr comment <N> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Reviewed against session goal: <one-line goal>.

Safe to merge:
- Meets goal: <one-line, file:line>
- Evidence: CI green on <SHA> (<check names>) / <curl output if applicable>
- Cleanup: removed <old thing> at <file:line>
- Scope: stayed within <surface>
EOF
)"
```

Then merge. Strategy by default: **squash** for feature/fix PRs (clean main history), **merge commit** for stacked PRs where you want to preserve the per-PR boundary. Use `--auto` only if CI is still running.

```bash
gh pr merge <N> --squash --delete-branch
# or for stacked PRs where each PR is its own logical unit:
gh pr merge <N> --merge --delete-branch
```

For stacked PRs: after merging the base, the next PR's base auto-retargets on GitHub if it was set to the previous head — but if your tooling didn't enable that, run `gh pr edit <next> --base main` and confirm `mergeStateStatus` becomes `clean` before merging the next one.

**8b. REQUEST_CHANGES verdict — comment with concrete asks.**

Bullet points, each `file:line — exact change — why`. No prose, no padding, no "great work overall." Example:

```bash
gh pr comment <N> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Blocking, in order:

- app/src/auth/login.tsx:42 — store session token via `setSession()` from auth/session.ts, not `localStorage.setItem('token', ...)`. Plaintext-token-in-localStorage was the bug fixed in PR #401 — this reintroduces it.
- app/src/auth/refresh.ts:18 — the `if (!res.ok)` branch returns without logging; the original handler in auth/legacy.go:88 emits a structured error. Add the same.
- app/src/auth/refresh.ts:3 — `import { unused } from './helpers'` is dead; remove.

Not blocking — leave for follow-up if you want:
- (nothing)
EOF
)"
```

Do NOT auto-request review from the user via `gh pr review --request-changes` unless `$ARGUMENTS` contains `formal-review` — a comment is enough and avoids notification noise. The subagent that produced the verdict is the source of truth; the comment is the artifact.

**8c. CLOSE_DUPLICATE verdict — comment + close.**

Quote the commit or PR that already contains the work, then close.

```bash
gh pr comment <N> --body "Closing as duplicate — this work is already in main as <SHA> (\"<commit subject>\") merged at <date>. The diff between this branch and main is empty modulo whitespace: \`git diff origin/main..<head>\` returns 0 substantive changes."
gh pr close <N> --delete-branch
```

If the duplicate is **another open PR** rather than already-merged work, link both ways:

```bash
gh pr comment <N> --body "Closing in favor of #<other>, which covers the same change and is further along. Continuing the conversation there."
gh pr comment <other> --body "Folded in scope from #<N> (closed)."
gh pr close <N> --delete-branch
```

### 9. Verify and report

After execution, re-query state in parallel:

```bash
gh pr list --state all --search "<the PR numbers we acted on>" --json number,state,mergedAt,closedAt
git fetch --prune origin
```

Report a final table — what merged, what got requested-changes, what closed, what (if anything) failed. For each merge, quote the merge commit SHA. For each request-changes, link the comment URL. For each close, quote the duplicate reference.

If any merge or close failed, do NOT silently move on — print the error, leave the PR in whatever state GitHub returned, and tell the user which one needs hand-resolution.

## Stacked-PR specifics

A stack is a chain `main ← A ← B ← C`. The rules:

- **Review order: leaf-down or root-up — your choice.** Either works; subagents run in parallel anyway. The verdicts come back independent.
- **Merge order: strictly root-up.** A before B before C. Never merge a child before its parent — that creates phantom commits in the child's diff and confuses subsequent reviews.
- **If the base verdict is REQUEST_CHANGES, every PR stacked on top is also blocked.** Mark them `BLOCKED — waiting on #<base>` and do not merge them, even if their own verdict was SHIP.
- **After merging A, retarget B's base to `main`** if GitHub didn't do it automatically: `gh pr edit <B> --base main`. Then re-check `mergeable` before merging B.
- **If B has merge conflicts after A lands**, do NOT rebase/force-push on the author's behalf without explicit user approval (see the project HARD LINE on destructive ops). Comment on B explaining the conflict and stop the chain.

## Duplicate detection

A PR is a duplicate when one of these is true — verify with a command before claiming it:

1. **Already in main:** `git rev-list --count <head>..origin/main` returns the same count as `git rev-list --count <base>..origin/main` (i.e., the head adds nothing). Also confirm with `git diff origin/main..<head> -- <files-changed>` returning empty/whitespace-only.
2. **Squashed-merged elsewhere:** the PR's commit messages or diff are subsumed by a recent main commit. Find it: `git log origin/main --oneline --since="14 days ago" | grep -i "<keyword from PR title>"`. Confirm the diff overlap by hand.
3. **Open elsewhere:** another open PR touches a strict superset of the same files for the same goal. Quote the PR number and the file overlap.

If you cannot run one of these commands and get a definitive answer, the verdict is NOT `CLOSE_DUPLICATE` — fall back to `REQUEST_CHANGES` with "needs human triage: possible duplicate of <SHA/#>".

## Don'ts

- Don't merge a PR whose verdict is REQUEST_CHANGES because it "looks mostly fine." The whole point of the verdict is to stop you.
- Don't merge without one of: green CI, a quoted run, or explicit user override. "I read the diff and it looks correct" is not evidence.
- Don't post review comments that demand abstractions, naming changes, or speculative future-proofing — those are noise that delay merges. The subagent rubric forbids them; the reviewer (you) does too.
- Don't merge stacked PRs out of order.
- Don't force-push, rebase the author's branch, or amend their commits to "help" — that's destructive (see project HARD LINE). Comment and let the author act.
- Don't auto-request formal review (`gh pr review --request-changes`) unless `$ARGUMENTS` contains `formal-review` — a comment is the lighter touch and doesn't ping reviewers redundantly.
- Don't summarize each PR with prose like "Overall this is a solid change that…". Verdicts are terse. Evidence is quoted. That's the whole document.
- Don't propose to stop after the recap. The recap is a checkpoint, not an exit ramp. Continue to the verdict matrix unless `$ARGUMENTS` contains `dry-run`.
- Don't fabricate a session goal because you can't find one. Ask the user in one sentence and continue.
