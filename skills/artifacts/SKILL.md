# Artifacts

Use `artifacts` to keep the source concise and durable: write Markdown once, add
semantic HTML or inline SVG only where layout requires it, then compile the same
source to responsive HTML and PDF. Do not hand-author a complete HTML document.

## Choose The Artifact

- `plan`: implementation intent, public interface, validation, risks, tracking.
- `report`: findings, evidence, and recommendations.
- `visual`: an infographic, comparison, diagram, or poster-led explanation.

Use the user's requested kind. Otherwise choose from the content, not the desired
output format; every kind can compile to HTML and PDF.

## Workflow

1. Check the installed tool:

   ```bash
   command -v artifacts
   ```

   If `artifacts` is missing, report that concrete prerequisite. Do not replace
   it with a hand-written HTML fallback.

2. Write the Markdown source directly. Every artifact requires `kind` (plan,
   report, or visual) and `title`; plans also require `surface` (`internal`,
   `cli`, `web`, `native`, `api`, or `workflow`). `template` is inferred and provenance
   (project, repository, branch, harness, agent, human, host, session, date)
   auto-fills at render time from the Git checkout and agent environment.
   Declared values always win — declare `links`, `tracking`, `status`, `facts`,
   `header`, `footer`, or any provenance value you want to control.

   **Attach work URLs in `links`.** Put every related ticket, PR, issue, or
   design-doc URL (Linear, Jira, GitHub, Notion, …) in the multipurpose
   `links` list so they render as clickable chips. Seed URLs you already have at
   first draft; if you open or create tickets while authoring, append those URLs
   to `links` and re-render before presenting. Entries are plain `https://`
   strings or `{url, label?}`. Keep a short primary id in `tracking` if useful;
   do not invent separate ticket/PR fields. Mirror the same URLs as Markdown
   links under `## Tracking` (plans) so the body stays readable without chip
   chrome.

   Follow the section structure for the kind (`artifacts template <kind>` shows
   it), or scaffold the whole file with `artifacts new <kind> --out <source.md>`.
   Do not repeat provenance in the body. Use normal headings, lists, tables,
   images, and fenced code. Reach for direct HTML only for grids, panels,
   figures, and callouts; reach for inline SVG for architecture, timelines,
   process diagrams, and other semantic figures. **Illustrate actively**: any
   concept that has structure — actors, layers, flows, comparisons, states —
   gets a real SVG figure, not a paragraph approximation. A figure earns its
   place with tinted concept boxes, labeled connectors, and a caption that names
   the reading order; follow the palette and layout recipe in
   [references/authoring.md](references/authoring.md#diagram-recipe) so figures
   look designed rather than incidental. Read
   [references/authoring.md](references/authoring.md)
   before adding HTML or SVG.

   **Plans are surface-gated.** An `internal` plan needs a live drawn SVG. Every
   user-visible surface needs a product-faithful `.artifact-behavior` figure with
   current and proposed states; label each state as a real `capture` or a faithful
   `mockup`. An architecture diagram does not substitute for CLI/UI/API behavior.
   Validation errors prevent HTML output. Load **plan-render** or this skill's
   diagram recipe when stuck. Tables, fenced commands, and an `artifact-callout`
   warn if missing.

3. Render in one step:

   ```bash
   artifacts render <source.md>                          # writes <source>.html next to it
   artifacts render <source.md> --format html,pdf        # both outputs
   artifacts render <source.md> --format pdf --layout poster
   ```

   Use `document` layout for paginated plans and reports, `poster` for visuals
   or when the user asks for one continuous page. Errors fail the render; fix
   them at the Markdown source or `DESIGN.md`, never by editing generated HTML.

4. Inspect the actual output headlessly. Verify both themes, desktop and mobile
   widths, image loading, diagram bounds, document overflow, and browser console
   errors. Use the available headless browser or screenshot tooling. Do not run
   `artifacts preview`, `open`, or another interactive-browser command unless the
   user explicitly asked for the artifact to be opened. Rasterize representative
   PDF pages and look for clipped code, split figures, missing backgrounds, or
   blank media.

5. Share only on explicit request:

   ```bash
   artifacts share <source.md> --expire 30d
   ```

   Shared links are public and unlisted, not private. Never place credentials in
   Markdown or `DESIGN.md`; use the configured share endpoint or
   `ARTIFACTS_SHARE_TOKEN`.

## Helpers

- `artifacts new <kind> --out <source.md>` — scaffold the frontmatter and
  section skeleton instead of writing it by hand.
- `artifacts init design` — adopt project-wide branding (`DESIGN.md`). Preserve
  an existing `DESIGN.md`; it owns both light and dark palettes, typography,
  density, radius, layout spacing, content width, and print margins. If exact
  fonts are required but unavailable, add local font files or register a
  directory with `artifacts setup --fonts-dir <dir>`; otherwise retain and
  report the emitted fallback-font warning.
- `artifacts check <source.md>` — validate without rendering.
- `artifacts estimate <source.md>` — exact `o200k_base` Markdown-versus-rendered
  token counts when the user asks about authoring-token cost.

## Completion Contract

- Markdown remains the source of truth; generated HTML/PDF are build outputs.
- Metadata appears once in frontmatter and renders into the document chrome.
- Existing project branding is preserved in both light and dark themes.
- `artifacts check` exits successfully, with any accepted warnings named.
- The rendered HTML has been inspected at desktop/mobile widths and in both themes.
- The requested PDF layout has been raster-inspected, not merely generated.
- No user browser was opened unless explicitly requested.
- Report the source, HTML, PDF, and optional share paths or URLs.
