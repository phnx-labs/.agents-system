# Teams Skill

Organize AI coding agents into teams for parallel collaboration. This skill teaches you how to use the `agents teams` CLI.

## Single Agent vs Teams

- **Single agent**: Use `agents run <agent> "prompt" --mode edit` for one-off tasks
- **Multiple agents**: Use `agents teams` when you need parallel execution

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a team
agents teams create my-feature

# Add teammates
agents teams add my-feature claude "Implement the auth middleware" --name auth
agents teams add my-feature codex "Build the login UI" --name frontend

# Start the team
agents teams start my-feature --watch
```

## Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `list` | List your teams, most recent activity first | `agents teams list` |
| `create` | Start a new team | `agents teams create my-team` |
| `add` | Add a teammate | `agents teams add my-team claude "Task" --name role` |
| `start` | Launch pending teammates | `agents teams start my-team --watch` |
| `status` | Check who's working | `agents teams status my-team` |
| `active` | List every teammate running right now, across all teams | `agents teams active` |
| `resume` | Resume a stopped teammate — re-enter its own session with a message | `agents teams resume my-team backend "review's in — merge it"` |
| `message` | Send a follow-up: steers a running teammate, resumes a stopped one | `agents teams message my-team qa "skip the flaky test"` |
| `stop` | Stop a running teammate (resume it later with `resume`) | `agents teams stop my-team frontend` |
| `pr-watch` | Watch the PRs a team opened and react (fix red CI / review comments) | `agents teams pr-watch my-team` |
| `logs` | Read teammate output | `agents teams logs my-team frontend` |
| `remove` | Remove a stopped teammate's logs | `agents teams remove my-team frontend` |
| `disband` | Stop all and remove | `agents teams disband my-team` |
| `doctor` | Check installed agents | `agents teams doctor` |

## DAG Dependencies

Use `--after` to create dependencies:

```bash
# Backend first
agents teams add my-feature claude "Build API" --name backend

# Frontend waits for backend
agents teams add my-feature codex "Build UI" --name frontend --after backend

# QA waits for both
agents teams add my-feature claude "Run tests" --name qa --after backend,frontend

# Start drains the DAG automatically
agents teams start my-feature --watch
```

## Distributed Teams (teammates on other machines)

Place teammates on **different machines** across your fleet (from `agents devices`)
instead of all on the box running `teams start`. One orchestrator still drives the
DAG, polls status, and cleans up — teammates just execute over SSH. One vocabulary —
`--device` / `--devices` (aliases `--host` / `--hosts`); all optional (omit it and
every teammate runs local, exactly as before).

```bash
# Send ONE teammate elsewhere — no pool needed
agents teams create feat
agents teams add feat claude "build the API" --name backend --device yosemite-s0
agents teams add feat claude "build the UI"  --name ui               # stays local
agents teams start feat --watch

# A device POOL — unpinned teammates auto-schedule across it (least-loaded)
agents teams create feat --devices zion,yosemite-s0 --repo https://github.com/you/repo.git
agents teams add feat claude "..." --name w1                         # auto-scheduled
agents teams add feat claude "..." --name w2 --device yosemite-s0    # or pin
```

**Where a teammate runs** — resolved at launch, top-down:

1. teammate `--device X` → **X** (explicit pin, no pool required)
2. else single-device pool → that device (whole team there)
3. else multi-device pool → **auto-scheduled** (least-loaded)
4. else → **local** (today's behavior)

- `--devices <list>` on `create` declares the pool; `--repo <url|path>` is how each
  device gets the code (defaults to the local checkout's `origin`, reused or cloned
  into `~/.agents/repos/<team>`). Per-teammate worktrees work over SSH too.
- `status` / `logs` show each teammate's host. **POSIX hosts only** in v1 (Windows
  hosts are rejected with a clear message).

## Modes

| Mode | Use When |
|------|----------|
| `plan` (default) | Read-only work: research, audit, analysis |
| `edit` | Code changes: implementation, refactoring |

Always use `--mode plan` for security audits, research, and analysis.

## Worktree Isolation (edit-mode teams)

By default all teammates share the current checkout. For parallel **edit** work, give each teammate its **own** git worktree so they don't collide on one working tree — one worktree per teammate type / independent surface.

```bash
# Turn on per-teammate isolation for the team
agents teams create my-feature --enable-worktrees

# Each teammate gets a dedicated worktree (.agents/worktrees/<name>, branch agents/<name>)
agents teams add my-feature claude "Owns: src/auth/*" --name auth --worktree auth --mode edit
agents teams add my-feature codex  "Owns: src/ui/*"   --name ui   --worktree ui   --mode edit
agents teams start my-feature --watch
```

- **Name the worktree after the surface** the teammate owns; the name must be **unique per teammate** (two teammates can't share one worktree name).
- `--cwd <dir>` sets a plain working directory for a teammate when you don't want a worktree.
- `--use-worktree <path>` on `create` makes **all** teammates share one existing checkout — the opposite of isolation; use only when every teammate must build against one tree.
- **Skip worktrees for `--mode plan`** teams — read-only, no contention.
- Worktrees are cleaned up on `stop`/`disband` when clean, and kept if they have uncommitted changes.

## Monitoring

```bash
# Check status
agents teams status my-feature

# Delta poll (efficient)
agents teams status my-feature --since 2026-04-24T09:00:00-07:00

# Read one teammate's log
agents teams logs my-feature frontend
```

## Resume / Message a Teammate

A teammate often stops with more to do — a PR left open awaiting review, a headless run that hit a turn cap, a task worth redirecting. `agents teams resume` re-enters that teammate's **own** session with your message as the next user turn, so it picks up with full context instead of you finishing by hand or spawning a fresh, context-less teammate.

```bash
# Nudge a teammate that stopped with its PR open:
agents teams resume my-feature backend "review's in — rebase-merge the PR, then release"

# teams message is the same command, auto-routed by the teammate's state:
agents teams message my-feature qa "skip the flaky screenshot test for now"
```

Routing: a **running** teammate is steered via its mailbox (delivered at its next tool call, no re-launch); a **stopped** one (completed / failed / stopped) is **resumed** — re-launched through its original backend/worktree and flipped back to `running`; a **pending** one is refused until you `teams start` it. Every harness: resume delegates to `agents run --resume` (native for Claude/Codex, `/continue` replay for the rest).

## Best Practices

- **Mix agents** if available — different agents have different blind spots
- **Use `--mode plan`** for read-only work (audits, research)
- **Give full context** — each teammate needs the big picture plus their specific task
- **Demand evidence** — end prompts with: `Return file:line quotes for every claim`
- **Run in parallel** — most tasks don't depend on each other
- **Name teammates** with `--name` for easy reference
- **Isolate edit-mode teammates** — `--enable-worktrees` on create + `--worktree <name>` per teammate, so parallel edits don't collide on one checkout

## Short Aliases

```
teams c  = create    teams a  = add       teams s  = status
teams rm = remove    teams d  = disband   teams ls = list
```
