# plan-render — plans as browser-ready HTML

A plan buried in terminal scrollback is hard to review. Render every implementation
plan as **one self-contained `.html`** (inline CSS, no CDN/framework — opens offline
by double-click) and open it in the user's default browser on the machine they sit at.
This is the single source of the plan LOOK; `/plan` Step 9 and `/swarm:plan` reference it.

Start from **`template.html`** (in this skill dir); **`example.html`** is the gold
reference (the remote-run bookkeeping plan).

## Where to write it

The render produces **one durable artifact** — the HTML. Pick its home once, up front:

- **Project-scoped plan** — if the repo you're working in has an **`.agents/` directory**
  (`ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)`; `test -d "$ROOT/.agents"`), write to
  `"$ROOT/.agents/plans/plan-<slug>.html"` (`mkdir -p "$ROOT/.agents/plans"` first). This
  keeps the plan **next to the code it describes** — durable, greppable, and the source the
  future download portal indexes. `.agents/` is scratch/artifact space (gitignored in these
  repos), so the file never lands on a branch.
- **No project / no `.agents/` dir** — fall back to `/tmp/plan-<slug>.html`.

Set `HTML` to that path; every step below refers to `$HTML`. The HTML is self-contained
(inline CSS, no CDN) so it opens offline by double-click **and** converts cleanly to PDF.

## Structure — fixed house layout

Every plan has, in order:

- **Hero** — `.kicker` (mono, uppercased: `PRODUCT · plan mode · …`), an `<h1>` with one
  `.accent` phrase, a ~3-line `.sub` problem statement, `.chip` metadata (files touched,
  new helpers, `status: awaiting go`), and a `.toc` of numbered sections.
- **Numbered `<h2>` sections** (`<span class="n">01</span>…`) — context/problem first,
  then design, then a files table, then edge cases / verification.
- **≥1 visual figure** in a `.fig` — use dither-kit for charts and quantitative
  dataviz; use hand-authored inline SVG for timelines, architecture sketches, and
  before/after `.grid2` comparisons. **Never mermaid.** Visuals are what make the
  plan land; a plan with zero figures is not done.
- **`.callout`** (and `.callout.warn`) for the load-bearing takeaway/caveat.
- **Tagged tables** — `.tag.a/.b/.c` pills (new / edit / keep) in the leftmost cell.
- **`<pre>`** code with `.c/.k/.s/.r` spans for the 1–2 key snippets.
- **`.foot`** — one mono line, ending `next: go / reshape`.

## Theme — match the product, don't impose one

Before rendering, **probe the target repo for its brand** and skin the plan in it by
editing only the two `:root` blocks (`--bg --panel --ink --dim --line --accent …`).
Fall through in order; first hit wins:

1. **Design tokens** — `design-system.css`, `theme.ts/css`, `tokens.json`, a `brand/` dir.
2. **Framework config** — `tailwind.config.*` theme colors, global CSS custom properties.
3. **Brand assets** — logo / favicon / `site.webmanifest` `theme_color`; sample the dominant hues.
4. **Live UI** — screenshots or a running app; eyedrop the palette.
5. **House fallback** — the dark + light editorial palette shipped in `template.html`,
   used **only** when the product declares no brand. Keep diagrams as dark blueprint cards.

Match the product's accent, surface, and ink; keep the house *structure* regardless.

## Light + dark, with a toggle

The house fallback ships **both** palettes and an in-page `◐` toggle (top-right) that
defaults to the OS `prefers-color-scheme` — so a user in bright light on a light-mode
machine gets the readable light theme automatically, and can flip either way. Keep the
toggle even when re-skinning to a brand that defines both light and dark tokens. The
light accent is darkened for AA contrast on a light surface (`--accent:#4d7c0f` in the
fallback); pick a similarly contrast-safe accent when theming.

## Deliver it — land a viewable copy on the machine the user sits at

The core rule: **the user must be able to open the plan on the machine in front of them.**
An HTML in `/tmp` on a headless Linux node is not viewable — most control-room viewing
happens on a Mac or Windows laptop. So always land a **PDF** (portable, opens everywhere,
what the download portal will track) in the **user's `~/Downloads`** on the machine they sit
at, and open the interactive HTML in their browser. Do this **proactively, every time**, so
an away user finds it waiting.

1. **Resolve the viewing machine.** From the **Host & Fleet** context injected at session
   start (`hooks/07-inject-device-topology.sh`), find the **online macOS device** where the
   user sits — resolve it dynamically, **never hardcode a host name**. If several Macs are
   online, prefer online+direct; ask once only if genuinely ambiguous.

2. **Make the PDF + drop it in Downloads + open the HTML.** Run this block **on the viewing
   machine** — directly if you're already on it (`hostname` matches), else copy the HTML there
   first and run the same block via `agents ssh <host>` with `HTML` pointed at the copy:

   ```bash
   scp "$HTML" <host>:/tmp/plan-$SLUG.html        # remote case only; then set HTML=/tmp/plan-$SLUG.html in the block
   ```

   PDF is generated with the browser stack (`agents browser`, which drives the machine's
   installed Chromium-family browser via CDP `Page.printToPDF`):

   ```bash
   SLUG=<kebab-slug>          # the plan topic, kebab-cased — same <slug> used for $HTML above
   HTML=<$HTML>               # local: the path from "Where to write it". remote: /tmp/plan-$SLUG.html
   agents browser start --task plan-$SLUG >/dev/null 2>&1
   agents browser navigate --task plan-$SLUG --url "file://$HTML" >/dev/null
   sleep 1                                            # let the page finish rendering
   # NOTE: the [output] positional is ignored in current builds — capture the auto-saved path.
   PDF=$(agents browser pdf --task plan-$SLUG 2>&1 | grep -oE '/[^ ]+\.pdf' | tail -1)
   agents browser done --task plan-$SLUG >/dev/null 2>&1
   if [ -d "$HOME/Downloads" ]; then                  # true on Mac + most Linux desktops
     cp "$HTML" "$HOME/Downloads/plan-$SLUG.html"     # interactive, offline — always if Downloads exists
     [ -n "$PDF" ] && cp "$PDF" "$HOME/Downloads/plan-$SLUG.pdf"   # portable; skipped if the browser step produced none
   fi
   open "$HTML" 2>/dev/null || xdg-open "$HTML" 2>/dev/null   # default browser
   ```

3. Tell the user it opened in their browser and the PDF is in **Downloads**, with a 2–3 line
   summary and the paths.

**Graceful degradation** (never block the plan on any of these):
- **No `~/Downloads`** (headless Linux / VM): skip the copy — that's fine, say so.
- **No reachable browser** on the viewer (no Chromium-family browser installed, or a
  headless-only fleet): skip the PDF and the open — still write the durable `$HTML` and tell
  the user where it is and how to open it.

## Checklist before you present

- [ ] Self-contained HTML written to `$HTML` — `<repo>/.agents/plans/` if the project has an
      `.agents/` dir, else `/tmp` — opens offline.
- [ ] Skinned in the product's brand, or the house fallback if none.
- [ ] ≥1 visual figure: dither-kit for charts/dataviz, inline SVG for diagrams; no
      mermaid, no CDN.
- [ ] Light/dark toggle present, defaults to `prefers-color-scheme`.
- [ ] PDF + HTML copied to the viewer's `~/Downloads` (or degradation noted).
- [ ] HTML opened on the resolved online Mac's default browser (or headless noted).
