# plan-render — plans as browser-ready HTML via artifacts-cli

Every implementation plan should be a beautiful, reviewable HTML page that opens in the user's browser. The source of truth is **Markdown**: concise, token-efficient, and durable. The rendering is handled by `artifacts-cli`.

## Non-negotiable quality bar (read this first)

A plan HTML that is **only prose + inline `code` pills** is a failed delivery.
Both the compiler and the cross-harness presentation gate enforce this:

| Must have | Why | Enforced by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `surface` frontmatter | The validator must know whether architecture or product behavior is the review surface | `artifacts check` **error** |
| Current + proposed product views for non-`internal` plans | Reviewers see the actual behavior change, not a prose approximation | `artifacts check` **error**; plan-html-reminder checks semantic HTML |
| ≥1 **live** drawn SVG for `internal` plans | Reviewers need a real architecture/flow/state figure | `artifacts check` **error** |
| ≥1 Markdown **table** (files / risks / validation) | Scanability | `artifacts check` warning |
| ≥1 **fenced** code block for commands/APIs | Inline `` `code` `` alone has no highlighting surface | `artifacts check` warning |
| ≥1 `artifact-callout` | Load-bearing takeaway | `artifacts check` warning |

Do **not** present until `artifacts render` exits 0. User-visible plans show both
current and proposed product views. Prefer captured screenshots or terminal output;
when capture is impossible, use a faithful mockup labeled `data-evidence="mockup"`.
Architecture diagrams do not substitute for behavior views.

**Anti-pattern (what just bit us):** dump issue notes as Markdown bullets, run `artifacts render`, open the HTML. That produces a dark page of monochrome pills with no figures and no code wells — unreadable.

## Output

- **HTML only** — no PDF is produced.
- **Destination** — write the Markdown source and rendered HTML under `.agents/artifacts/yyyy-mm-dd/` (create the date dir if missing). Same layout as any related artifact.
- **Self-contained** — the HTML has inline CSS, no CDN, and opens offline.

## Workflow

1. **Check the tool.**

   ```bash
   command -v artifacts
   ```

   If `artifacts` is missing, install artifacts-cli first and report the prerequisite.

2. **Resolve the repo root and dated artifact home.**

   ```bash
   ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
   DATE=$(date +%F)
   ARTIFACTS_DIR="${ROOT:-.}/.agents/artifacts/$DATE"
   mkdir -p "$ARTIFACTS_DIR"
   ```

3. **Author the Markdown source.**

   Write `"$ARTIFACTS_DIR/plan-<slug>.md"` (i.e. `.agents/artifacts/yyyy-mm-dd/plan-<slug>.md`) with at least this frontmatter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   kind: plan
   surface: internal | cli | web | native | api | workflow
   title: <plain, factual headline>
   summary: <~3-line problem statement and intended outcome>
   status: draft | implementing | awaiting-go
   tracking: "#<ticket-or-issue>"
   facts:
     - <key fact>
     - <key fact>
   ---
   ```

   Use the section structure required by the `plan` template:

   - `## Purpose` — what's broken or needed
   - `## Proposed Changes` — the change, with concrete files and functions
   - `## Public Interface` — commands, flags, or APIs introduced
   - `## Validation` — how to verify the change
   - `## Risks` — edge cases and mitigations
   - `## Tracking` — ticket links / next step

   A tagged files table and any other supporting tables can appear inside the relevant section.

   Use normal Markdown for prose, lists, tables, and code. Use inline HTML only for layouts Markdown cannot express (grids, panels, callouts) and **inline SVG for figures**.

4. **Show the behavior, then supporting architecture.**

   For `cli`, `web`, `native`, `api`, and `workflow`, include one
   `.artifact-behavior` figure with `data-state="current"` and
   `data-state="proposed"`. Give each state `data-evidence="capture"` or
   `data-evidence="mockup"`. Match the real product layout, components, typography,
   and output; a conceptual box diagram does not count.

   For `internal`, use a real architecture, flow, timeline, or state figure.

5. **Make supporting figures interactive and beautiful.**

   The rendered HTML should look like a polished artifact, not a document. Use inline SVG liberally for:

   - architecture diagrams
   - timelines
   - before/after comparisons
   - flow charts
   - state machines

   Add interactivity where it helps readability:

   - **SMIL animation** for motion, geometry, transform, or paint changes
   - **CSS hover states** for emphasis or revealing detail
   - **clickable layers** or tabs for alternate views
   - **progressive disclosure** with `<details>` / `<summary>` blocks

   Every figure needs a clear reading order, labeled connectors, a caption, and a legend when color or line-style carries meaning. Follow the diagram conventions in `diagram-conventions.md` (this skill dir).

6. **Render to HTML.**

   ```bash
   SOURCE="$ARTIFACTS_DIR/plan-<slug>.md"
   artifacts render "$SOURCE" --format html
   ```

   This writes `plan-<slug>.html` next to the source.

7. **Inspect the output headlessly.**

   Open the rendered HTML in a headless browser and check:

   - both light and dark themes render correctly
   - desktop and mobile widths reflow cleanly
   - SVG figures are visible and animated/interactive elements work
   - no browser console errors

8. **Deliver it to the user's machine.**

   Resolve the online macOS device from the Host & Fleet context (never hardcode). If already on that machine, open directly; otherwise copy the HTML over:

   ```bash
   scp "$ARTIFACTS_DIR/plan-<slug>.html" <host>:/tmp/plan-<slug>.html
   agents ssh <host> 'open /tmp/plan-<slug>.html'
   ```

   Also copy the HTML into `~/Downloads` on the viewer's machine for portability:

   ```bash
   cp "$ARTIFACTS_DIR/plan-<slug>.html" "$HOME/Downloads/plan-<slug>.html"
   ```

   If there is no reachable browser host, still write the durable source + HTML and tell the user the exact path.

## Design and theming

- Use `artifacts init design` to create a project-wide `DESIGN.md` if one does not exist.
- Preserve an existing `DESIGN.md`; it owns both light and dark palettes, typography, density, radius, and layout spacing.
- Probe the target repo for brand tokens (design-system.css, tailwind config, logo/favicon colors) and reflect them in `DESIGN.md`.
- The light/dark toggle must be present and default to `prefers-color-scheme`.

## Voice

- The headline states plainly what the plan does.
- Name concrete files, functions, flags, and error strings.
- No marketing register: no "seamless", "powerful", "robust", "leverage", "simply".
- At most one em-dash per paragraph; never stack appositive dashes.

## Completion contract

- [ ] Markdown source written to `.agents/artifacts/yyyy-mm-dd/plan-<slug>.md` (not `/tmp/scratchpad`)
- [ ] `surface` declares the review surface; non-internal plans show current + proposed capture/mockup evidence
- [ ] `artifacts check` reports **no errors**
- [ ] HTML rendered next to the source with `artifacts render ... --format html` (exit 0)
- [ ] Grep the HTML: internal plan has a drawn SVG, or user-visible plan has `.artifact-behavior` plus current/proposed evidence; at least one `<pre`/`<table`
- [ ] Output inspected headlessly in both themes and at desktop/mobile widths
- [ ] HTML opened on the user's machine and copied to `~/Downloads`
- [ ] Source, HTML path, and any warnings reported to the user
