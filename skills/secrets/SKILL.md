# Secrets Skill

Manage named bundles of environment variables backed by macOS Keychain. This skill teaches you how to use the `agents secrets` CLI.

## Concepts

- **Bundle** — A named container for secrets (e.g., "production", "staging", "stripe")
- **Secret** — A key-value pair inside a bundle
- **Keychain** — Secrets are stored in macOS Keychain by default (never touch disk in plaintext)

## Quick Start

```bash
# List bundles
agents secrets list

# Create a bundle
agents secrets create production

# Add a secret
agents secrets add production STRIPE_API_KEY
# Enter value when prompted (stored in Keychain)

# Use in an agent run
agents run --secrets production
```

## Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `list` | List bundles | `agents secrets list` |
| `view` | Show a bundle | `agents secrets view production` |
| `create` | Create empty bundle | `agents secrets create staging` |
| `delete` | Delete a bundle | `agents secrets delete staging` |
| `add` | Add a secret | `agents secrets add staging API_KEY` |
| `remove` | Remove a secret | `agents secrets remove staging API_KEY` |
| `import` | Import from .env or 1Password | `agents secrets import .env production` |
| `export` | Export to file or 1Password | `agents secrets export production .env` |

## Adding Secrets

```bash
# Keychain-backed (default)
agents secrets add production STRIPE_API_KEY
# Prompts for value, stores in Keychain

# Literal value
agents secrets add production DEBUG true --value

# From environment variable
agents secrets add production PATH --env

# From file
agents secrets add production CERT --file /path/to/cert.pem

# From command output
agents secrets add production TOKEN --exec "cat /tmp/token"
```

## Viewing Secrets

```bash
# Masked (default)
agents secrets view production

# Revealed (be careful)
agents secrets view production --reveal
```

## Remote secrets (other hosts)

Browse and *use* the bundles that live on another machine, over SSH. Hosts
resolve through the `agents hosts` registry, an ssh-config alias, or `user@host`.
Use `--host` for one host and `--hosts` for a comma-separated list.

```bash
# Browse bundles on one host, or several at once (grouped by host)
agents secrets list  --host yosemite-s1
agents secrets list  --hosts yosemite-s0,yosemite-s1
agents secrets view  --host yosemite-s1 r2.backups --reveal --plaintext

# Use a remote bundle ephemerally — values are injected, never stored locally
agents secrets exec  --host yosemite-s1 r2.backups -- ./deploy.sh
agents run claude "ship it" --secrets r2.backups@yosemite-s1   # bundle@host
```

- **`bundle@host`** is the reference form for `agents run --secrets`; local and
  remote bundles mix freely in one run.
- **Ephemeral.** Remote values cross over SSH and are injected into the
  run/command env in memory — never written to this machine's keychain or disk.
- **The remote unlocks with its own credentials.** A file-backed remote bundle
  reads headlessly via the remote's own `AGENTS_SECRETS_PASSPHRASE`; a keychain
  bundle on a macOS remote blocks on Touch ID under non-interactive SSH — use a
  remote `file` bundle, an unlocked remote secrets-agent, or run `view --reveal`
  from an interactive terminal (it forces an SSH TTY so the prompt can surface).

### Push a bundle to another machine (`export --host`) — incl. Windows

```bash
# Push a bundle over SSH; it lands in the remote's native store. Works to
# macOS, Linux AND Windows targets (Windows lands in Credential Manager, or the
# headless file store when there's no logon session).
agents secrets export linear.app --host win-mini --force
agents secrets export r2.backups --host yosemite-s0 --host yosemite-s1
```

You don't do anything different for a Windows host — the push detects the
remote's platform and drives its `agents secrets import` under PowerShell instead
of `bash`. (Over a relayed link the push can take ~30-40s; that's the link, not a
hang.) `--remote-backend file` is POSIX-only and is refused cleanly on Windows.

### Unlock a remote Mac's bundle from the road (`unlock --host`)

```bash
# Away from the Mac Mini: unlock its FILE-backed bundle by typing the passphrase
# into YOUR terminal — the prompt surfaces over the ssh -tt session.
agents secrets unlock linear.app --host mac-mini
```

`unlock --host <machine> <bundle>` runs the unlock on the remote over `ssh -tt`,
so the remote's passphrase prompt appears on your terminal. Only **file-backed**
bundles work this way (their passphrase is a CLI prompt held in the remote's
secrets-agent, default 7d); a keychain/biometry bundle would pop a **local**
Touch-ID/passcode sheet on the remote's screen, which can't cross SSH. `--host`
here is single-valued, so put the bundle name first: `unlock <bundle> --host <machine>`.
Type the password interactively — it can't be piped.

## Multiple Accounts on One Website

Name the bundle after the domain (`x.com`, `linkedin.com`) — one bundle per site, any number of accounts inside. Group keys by account handle and give every account a `--note` saying when to use it:

```bash
agents secrets create x.com --description "X/Twitter accounts. Read key notes to pick the right one."

agents secrets add x.com THEMUQSIT_USERNAME --value themuqsit \
  --note "Personal account. Casual engagement, research."
agents secrets add x.com THEMUQSIT_PASSWORD --type password \
  --note "Password for @themuqsit"
agents secrets add x.com GETONRUSH_USERNAME --value GetOnRush \
  --note "Product account for promoting Rush. Marketing, announcements."
agents secrets add x.com GETONRUSH_PASSWORD --type password \
  --note "Password for @GetOnRush"
```

Key naming: uppercase the handle, replace non-alphanumerics with `_`, suffix `_USERNAME` / `_PASSWORD` (plus `_EMAIL` for the login email and `_TOTP_SECRET` for 2FA accounts).

To pick an account, run `agents secrets view x.com` — notes print in the clear while values stay masked. Reveal only the pair you need:

```bash
agents secrets export x.com --plaintext | grep '^GETONRUSH_'
```

For browser logins, bind the bundle to a profile so it injects at browser start: `agents browser profiles create x --browser chrome --secrets x.com`.

## 1Password Integration

```bash
# Import from 1Password vault
agents secrets import 1password:MyVault production

# Export to 1Password vault
agents secrets export production 1password:MyVault
```

Requires the `op` CLI signed in.

## Security

- Keychain-backed values never touch disk in plaintext
- Use `--reveal` sparingly and only when necessary
- Delete bundles when no longer needed
- Use separate bundles for different environments (dev, staging, production)
