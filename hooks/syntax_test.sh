#!/usr/bin/env bash
# hooks/syntax_test.sh — proves every hook script actually parses.
#
# Why this exists: a Stop/PreToolUse hook that does not parse still RUNS. bash
# exits 2 on a syntax error, and exit 2 is the harness's "block" code — so a
# typo turns every hook into a permanent gate that no session can get past.
# That shipped: 2615e49 ("task-aware keep-moving gate") landed a heredoc whose
# body carried a lone `'`, and bash 3.2 — /bin/bash on every macOS box — tracks
# quotes inside a heredoc that sits in a $(...). The script became unparseable,
# exited 2 on every Stop, and blocked sessions fleet-wide until it was found by
# hand. The hook's own _test.sh was red the whole time; nobody ran it.
#
# The bash-3.2 part is the trap worth naming: bash 5 (every Linux box here)
# parses that same file FINE. So `bash -n` under the developer's shell is not
# enough — this checks /bin/bash explicitly, which is 3.2 on macOS and is what
# `#!/usr/bin/env bash` actually resolves to there.
#
# Covers *.sh in hooks/ and one-level group dirs; *.py is checked with
# `python3 -m py_compile` for the same reason.
