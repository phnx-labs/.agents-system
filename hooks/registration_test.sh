# hooks/registration_test.sh — proves no hook script has silently lost its
# registration in ../agents.yaml and proves the default-on prompt expansion
# hooks have not silently been disabled.
#
# Why this exists: a hook needs TWO things to fire — the script AND its `hooks:`
# entry in ../agents.yaml. Only the script is exercised by its own `_test.sh`,
# so a dropped registration is invisible: the script keeps passing its test
# while never running. This has happened twice (606db6e May 13, 8b006a6 Jun 24;
# see hooks/AGENTS.md), each time as collateral in a commit whose subject said
# nothing about it. `large-file-add-guard` — a data-loss guard — was off for six
# weeks that way. This is the failing test that "is it registered" never had.
#
# For every *.sh / *.py in hooks/ and one-level group dirs (hooks/session-starts/,
# …), excluding the test harness itself (*_test.sh and run_tests.sh), it asserts
# ONE of:
#   1. it has a `script:` entry in ../agents.yaml (basename match), OR
#   2. it is invoked by a script that itself IS registered — the
#      verify-delivery-chain.py case: no entry of its own, but piped into by
#      00-agent-verify-work-complete.sh, which is registered as
#      verify-work-complete and runs on every Stop, OR
#   3. it is in the INTENTIONALLY_UNREGISTERED allowlist below, with a reason.
# Anything matching none of those fails.
#
# Case 2 searches ONLY within registered scripts, so the "referenced but the
# caller is itself unregistered" trap does not pass: 02-expand-prompt-bang-
# commands.py is referenced by 02-expand-prompt-skill-refs.py, but that caller
# has no entry, so a reference from it would not count (bang-commands passes
# only because it has its own entry, expand-bang-commands).
#
# Manifest is resolved from $HERE/../agents.yaml; override with
