# --- Open-PR abandonment gate ------------------------------------------------
# A session that CREATED pull requests may not stop while any is still open,
# unless the final message explicitly hands the PR off. "PR open, waiting for
# reviewer" is not a stop state — merged-or-handed-off is done. This fires
# independently of the done-claim check below: the observed failure mode is
# agents stopping WITHOUT claiming done ("waiting for CI/review") and being
# marked completed with stranded PRs.
#
# Precision guard: a PR counts as session-created only when its URL appears
# in the tool_result of a tool_use whose command ran `pr create` — the two are
# paired by tool_use_id, so viewing/reviewing someone else's PR (even in a
# session that also created PRs) never triggers the gate. Fail-open: no gh,
# network down, parse errors — allow the stop.

STOP GATE: This session created pull request(s) that are still OPEN:

$open_prs
An open PR is not a finished task — merged-or-handed-off is done. Before
stopping you must do ONE of:
1. Keep driving it: watch CI (background gh pr checks --watch), get the
   non-author review, and merge on green.
2. Hand it off EXPLICITLY: name who or what now owns the PR (a person, a
   session, a watcher) in your final message.
3. If stopping is genuinely correct (e.g. blocked on input only the user can
   give), state exactly what is blocking and what happens next.

Then finish your final message and stop again.

STOP GATE: You claimed this work is done, but you must verify before stopping.

The user's original request was:
"$first_user_msg"

Before you can stop, you MUST:
1. Re-read the full conversation from the beginning
2. List EVERY goal, requirement, and question the user raised
3. For each goal, state one of:
   - DONE and TESTED end-to-end (cite the tangible output — test result, screenshot, live behavior)
   - DONE but UNTESTED (state what verification is missing, then go do it)
   - NOT DONE (continue working on it now)
4. If ANY goal is UNTESTED or NOT DONE, keep working. Do not stop.

Only stop when every goal has tangible, verified results.
