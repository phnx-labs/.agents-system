# any is still open, unless the final message explicitly hands the PR off. "PR
# open, waiting for reviewer" is not a stop state — merged-or-handed-off is
# done. This fires independently of the done-claim check below: the observed
# failure modes are (1) agents stopping WITHOUT claiming done ("waiting for
# CI/review") with stranded PRs they created, and (2) a session that INHERITED
# an open PR a prior session created, drove it (merge/checks/review), then
# stopped with it unmerged.
#
# A PR is attributed to THIS session two ways:
#   - CREATED: its URL appears in the tool_result of a tool_use whose command
#     ran `pr create` — paired by tool_use_id (the original precision guard).
#   - WORKED: a tool_use command OPERATED on the PR via
#     `gh pr merge|checks|review|ready|rebase|comment|close|reopen|edit <PR>`.
# A bare `gh pr view` is deliberately NOT a "worked" signal — reading someone
# else's PR is incidental; `view` only attributes a PR when the SAME PR is

$open_prs
An open PR is not a finished task — merged-or-handed-off is done. Before
stopping you must do ONE of:
1. Keep driving it: watch CI (background gh pr checks --watch), get the
   non-author review, and merge on green yourself. Do NOT open the PR link
   for the user or ask them to click merge.
2. Non-author review path: if the automated code reviewer is configured and
   posting (e.g. prix-cloud), wait for it. If it is missing, silent, down, or
   the repo has none — spawn a non-author subagent review NOW (code:review /
   Agent that is not the author). Do not wait, and do not hand the merge to
   the user because the bot is down.
3. Hand it off EXPLICITLY only when someone/something else truly owns it: name
   who or what now owns the PR (a person, a session, a watcher) in your final
   message. "Needs you to merge" / "open the PR" is NOT a handoff.
4. If stopping is genuinely correct — a GENUINE external blocker you cannot
   resolve — name it ("blocked on <what>") AND point to either a LIVE process
   that will finish it (a background "gh pr checks --watch" / "watcher" that will
   "merge on green") or an action only your biometric can do ("your Touch ID").
   Wanting a human REVIEW is NOT this case: keep driving it (spawn a reviewer)
   or hand it off explicitly by naming the owner (option 3) — "awaiting your
   review" will NOT pass this gate.

Then finish your final message and stop again.

Every track's PR merging green is NOT proof the composed feature works — each
teammate's tests and reviewer only ever saw that teammate's own diff. The seam
BETWEEN tracks (where one track calls what another built) is the one thing no
track verified, and it is exactly where the feature breaks.

Before you can stop, you MUST:
1. List every seam where one track calls/imports/hits what another track built.
2. For each seam, TRIGGER the composed cross-track flow against where the
   feature actually runs (the running daemon / installed binary / deployed
   service — merged to main is NOT deployed) and QUOTE the real output.
3. If a seam genuinely cannot be exercised, name that hop as UNVERIFIED — do
   not fold it into a "done end-to-end" claim.

"All PRs merged" / a table of green checkmarks is a report of merges, not proof
of a working feature. Go run the composed flow, then report with quoted output.

STOP GATE (handback): You wrote a runnable script to a temp path and your final
message tells the user to run it. You have the SAME shell + ssh the user does —
handing them a command you could run yourself is the hand-back this repo exists
to prevent ("No, you release it..").

Before you can stop, do ONE of:
1. RUN IT YOURSELF (the default — you almost always can). Execute the script or
   command you just prepared, then report the real result.
2. If a step genuinely needs the USER (a biometric, an interactive login on their
   own machine), say so explicitly ("needs your Touch ID" / "interactive login")
   — that phrasing clears this gate.
3. If you are blocked and it is NOT a user-only gate, do NOT stop in this window:
   reach the user OUT-OF-BAND (message them) so you get their attention, keep
   working every other thread meanwhile, and escalate if they do not reply. A
   chat message in this window is a note in an empty room — the user is not
   watching it.

Then finish your final message and stop again.

# still holds pending / in_progress items, the agent is stopping before its work

# background watcher is NOT blanket permission to stop — it should free the agent
# to advance the NEXT item, and only stop when nothing else is advanceable.
#
# Fires when the folded checklist has >=1 remaining item AND the final message is
# a plain declarative stop. It does NOT fire (a legitimate stop) when the message:
#   - asks the USER for input / a decision (a real clarifying question), OR
#   - is in plan mode (physically can't act), OR
#   - names a genuine external blocker + who/what will finish it, OR

#     (a real ScheduleWakeup/Monitor/`gh pr checks --watch` tool_use this session,
#     never phrasing alone — the same evidence bar the open-PR gate uses).

A checklist is your acceptance rubric — you are done when every item is completed,
not before. Recognizing a background watcher on one item is not permission to stop
the rest. Before stopping, do ONE of:
1. Advance the next item now — do the work, then mark it completed (TaskUpdate
   status=completed). Then move to the following item; stop only when nothing is
   left to advance.
2. If the item is genuinely owned by someone/something else — a live background
   watcher, another session, or a person — name that owner explicitly in your
   final message (that hands it off).
3. If it is blocked on a genuine external step you cannot do (a biometric, an
   interactive login), name the blocker ("blocked on <what>") and what will
   finish it.
4. If the item is no longer needed, delete it (TaskUpdate status=deleted) so the
   list reflects reality.

Do not stop with unfinished items and no owner named.

STOP GATE: You claimed this work is done, but you must verify before stopping.

The user's request(s) this session — re-read the FULL conversation for the rest,
including any later corrections:
"$first_user_msg"

Before you can stop, you MUST:
1. Re-read the full conversation from the beginning
2. List EVERY goal, requirement, and question the user raised
3. For each goal, state one of:
   - DONE and TESTED end-to-end (cite the tangible output — test result, screenshot, live behavior)
   - DONE but UNTESTED (state what verification is missing, then go do it)
   - NOT DONE (continue working on it now)
4. If ANY goal is UNTESTED or NOT DONE, keep working. Do not stop.
5. Once EVERY goal is DONE and verified, close out in this order:
   a. New follow-up ideas, improvements, or issues you noticed along the way that
      are out of scope for this session: FILE them as tickets via the project's
      tracker right now, with real context (what you found, why it's out of
      scope, any evidence) — not a one-line stub. Do not just mention an idea
      and wait ('say the word', 'let me know if you want this') — either do it,
      file it as tracked work, or drop it. A dangling optional idea is not a
      finished session.
   b. Clean up loose ends: commit and push any stray uncommitted work, remove
      worktrees and branches this session no longer needs, and confirm every
      ticket this session actually finished is closed with proof (not left
      Todo because it slipped your mind).
   c. Post ONE quick status update the way you would update a human manager — the
      headline outcome + the one link/next-step, not a transcript:
       agents feed post --title "<short outcome>" "<what you delivered + the one next step>" --level important
      This records the completion and marks this phone-worthy successful update
      for owner delivery.
   d. This session is now genuinely finished. If this is a headless, dispatched,
      or background run — not a live terminal a person might be actively
      watching right now — run /done as your very last action: its own Step 1
      builds the real handoff recap (the /recap discipline — facts, what's
      done, tests actually run, nothing left dangling) as your final message,
      THEN its Step 2 self-exits via the guarded SIGTERM (do not hand-roll a
      bare SIGTERM, and do not skip straight to Step 2 — a self-exit with no
      recap first is not a clean handoff). If you are unsure, or this looks
      like an interactive session someone is driving, run /recap instead (same
      handoff discipline, no self-exit) and then just stop.

Only stop when every goal has tangible, verified results, any real follow-ups are
filed with context (not dangled or stubbed), loose ends are cleaned up, and — if
applicable — the session has recapped and cleanly exited itself.
