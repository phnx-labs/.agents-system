# --- check outcome recording ---------------------------------------------------
# Every check evaluation is recorded, not just the ones that block. Recording only
# blocks is why the events table held 325 rows and every single one read 'blocked':
# there was no denominator, so no check had a false-positive rate and no change to
# check logic could be shown to be an improvement.
#
# Batched deliberately. A stop evaluates many checks and most of them allow, but a
# bare `python3` start costs ~18ms before sqlite3 is even imported — a process per
# check would tax every stop on every machine for telemetry nobody reads in the
# moment. So callers accumulate and a single flush writes them through one
# connection on exit.
#
# Tradeoff, stated: a hard kill (SIGKILL, or the harness timing the hook out
# without a signal) loses the batch. That costs telemetry, never correctness — the
# block itself is the exit code, not the row.

# --- Open-PR abandonment check ------------------------------------------------
# A session that CREATED *or actively WORKED* a pull request may not stop while
# any is still open, unless the final message explicitly hands the PR off. "PR
# open, waiting for reviewer" is not a stop state — merged-or-handed-off is
# done. This fires independently of the done-claim check below: the observed
# failure modes are (1) agents stopping WITHOUT claiming done ("waiting for
# CI/review") with stranded PRs they created, and (2) a session that INHERITED
# an open PR a prior session created, drove it (merge/checks/review), then
# stopped with it unmerged.
#
# A PR is attributed to THIS session two ways:
#   - CREATED: its URL appears in the tool_result of a tool_use whose command
#     ran `pr create` — paired by tool_use_id (the original precision guard).
#   - WORKED: a tool_use command OPERATED on the PR via
#     `gh pr merge|checks|review|ready|rebase|comment|close|reopen|edit <PR>`.
# A bare `gh pr view` is deliberately NOT a "worked" signal — reading someone
# else's PR is incidental; `view` only attributes a PR when the SAME PR is
# viewed 2+ times (active babysitting). So one incidental read of an unrelated

re-invokes you. On every wake while a team runs, drive then re-arm:
  1. One concrete drive action — merge a PR that is green and mergeable, steer
     or resume a stalled teammate, re-dispatch a dead track.
  2. Re-arm the next bounded tick BEFORE stopping — a background command
     (run_in_background: true) shaped like
       sleep 300; agents teams status <team>; echo TICK done
     — or arm a durable watcher (`agents monitors add`, ScheduleWakeup) and
     park quoting it.
A status recap with no re-arm is abandonment. `teams start --watch` settles
only when the WHOLE team settles — a single PR merge never re-invokes you
through it, so "surface on the next real event" parks forever.

# --- end live-team tick check ---------------------------------------------------

# --- command-handback check ----------------------------------------------------
# The observed failure (a real correction — "No, you release it.."): an agent
# prepares a runnable script the user did NOT ask it to hand over — it writes
# /tmp/release.sh and its final message tells the user to RUN it — instead of
# running it itself or escalating. This slips past every other check: writing to
# /tmp is unguarded, a DECLARATIVE handoff ("Run it when ready.") has no '?' so
# the permission-stop guards miss it, and it makes no done-claim so the audit
# check below never sees it. The agent has the SAME shell + ssh the user does, so
# handing over a command it could run is exactly the hand-back this repo bans.
#
# Fires only when BOTH hold, to stay high-precision (a bare /tmp script write is
# often legitimate — a background job, the agent's own scratch):
#   (1) this session WROTE a runnable script to a temp path — a Write/Edit tool
#       to /tmp|/var/folders ...(.sh/.bash/.zsh/.command), or a shell
#       redirect/heredoc/tee/cp that lands such a script there, AND
#   (2) the final message DIRECTS the user to run/paste/execute it, EXCLUDING two
#       shapes that are NOT running a command: pasting/typing text INTO a UI
#       form/field/composer (data entry, e.g. 'paste that blurb into the
#       application'), and sending a message/email/reply under the user's own
#       identity ('hit send'). A plain 'just run it when you're ready' after a
#       temp-script write still fires — that is the canonical handback.
# Exempts a genuine user-only check — a biometric / interactive login, or sending
# a message/email under the user's own identity — those are legitimate handoffs
# the agent cannot perform. stop_hook_active (top of file)
# makes it fire at most once; running the script (or naming the user-only check)
